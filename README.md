# Computer-Vision-Deep-Learning-Applications

Multilabel object classification on the PASCAL VOC-2009 dataset, with 20 different classes. We trained CNNs from scratch for classification and segmentation. 
My particular contribution to this project was in exploring adversarial attacks to test the robustness of our models.
